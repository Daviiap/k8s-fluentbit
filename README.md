# K8s FluentBit

Study project to implement a [FluentBit](https://fluentbit.io/) in a [Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster with [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/).

The main objective of this project is to understand how does the FluentBit works and how it communicates with both the application that provides the data and the application that consumes it, and how all this works in a K8s Cluster.
